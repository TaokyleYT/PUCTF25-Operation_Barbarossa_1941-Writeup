## Situation

Operation Barbarossa, 1941

June 1941. Tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union have reached a breaking point. The shadow of war looms heavily over both nations. As a member of the British intelligence service, you’ve just intercepted a crucial encrypted message sent from German High Command to the Soviet frontlines. The outbreak of war is imminent, and we must uncover the contents of this message before it’s too late.

Fortunately, a brave agent embedded within German High Command has risked everything to provide us with vital intelligence:

This message is addressed to a reconnaissance regiment, meaning the plaintext must begin with “recon unit from...”.

Time is of the essence, and the German operation could commence at any moment! You must act immediately to break this code. Any delay could have catastrophic consequences. The fate of the mission—and perhaps the war itself—rests in your hands.
